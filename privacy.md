# Privacy Policy for RateMyGaucho

**Last Updated:** September 7, 2025

Thank you for using RateMyGaucho. This privacy policy outlines our commitment to your privacy and explains what information the extension does and does not collect.

### 1. No Data Collection

RateMyGaucho is designed with user privacy as a core principle. The extension **does not collect, store, transmit, or sell any personal data or user information**. This includes, but is not limited to:

-   Personally Identifiable Information (name, email, etc.)
-   Web History
-   User Activity (clicks, mouse movements, keystrokes)
-   Location Data
-   Authentication Information

### 2. How the Extension Works

RateMyGaucho functions entirely on your local device. Its process is as follows:
1.  It reads a pre-packaged, offline data file (`scores.csv`) containing professor ratings.
2.  When you visit a UCSB GOLD course search page, the extension reads the publicly visible instructor names on that page.
3.  It cross-references these names with its local data file.
4.  It displays the corresponding rating directly on the page for your convenience.

All processing occurs locally in your browser. No information about you or your browsing activity ever leaves your computer.

### 3. Permissions Explained

The extension requests the minimum permissions necessary to function:
-   **Host Permission (`*.gold.ucsb.edu`):** This permission is required to allow the extension to read instructor names from and display rating cards on UCSB GOLD pages. The extension does not interact with any other websites.
-   **Storage:** This permission is used to cache the rating data locally, which makes the extension load faster after its first use. No personal information is stored.

### 4. Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy in the future. Any changes will be reflected on this page.
