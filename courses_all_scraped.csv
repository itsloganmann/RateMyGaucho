Additionally, we examine financialization and its implications for developing and emerging economies.

I came to an office hour 30 minutes after it was done and she was still in there helping people and then helped me.

It's an extremely doable A and his grading is fair. His tests are copies of the homework so there are no surprises.

It was just boring at times but beneficial for my scientific writing skills. He gives the necessary feedback and really wants you to do well. I thought I was an awful writer but never got below an 85 on any of the 3 papers and weekly assignments were graded by completion.,"Kenny is the best writing professor you'll ever have. Is clear about grading method. For my class it was dependent on your PROGRESS and REVISIONS after he reviewed your first draft, not what you turn in the first time. Very caring and accessible.","Had arnd.3 reading assignments, 1-2 pages and posted on gauchospace&amp;you just have to write a small paragraph on what it was about. His class is graded on 3 essays, so each essay is worth a lot. 1st essay was 15%, 2nd was 30%, 3rd was 40%. Rest is participation&amp;attendance. does require for each essay a peer review &amp; one on one session with him!"

I learned so much about philosophy and government, and how to read / research better with guided personalized questions.","Definitely one of the more interesting writing classes I've taken at UCSB. Explores a lot of relevant ideas between political philosophy, labor, and the environment. He's fun to talk to during office hours. Sometimes I wanted more lectures, but I also like the way he interacts with us in small groups.","It had practical and real world applications in government, policy, ethics, and the environment. The papers are designed to let students jump off of the readings and research their own interests. His lecture style works off of student participation. His comments are sooo helpful."
