# RateMyGaucho (Chrome Extension)

RateMyGaucho enhances UCSB GOLD by showing professor ratings and course data directly on course result pages. It works offline and preserves your privacy by using a local dataset.

## Novel Features

*   **Offline & Private**: Works without an internet connection and never sends your data to external servers. All data is stored locally in CSV files.
*   **Gaucho-Themed Ratings**: Displays professor ratings with custom, partially-filled Gaucho star icons for at-a-glance assessments.
*   **In-Depth Course Data**: Goes beyond professor ratings to show course-specific details like grading trends, enrollment history, and recent student reviews.
*   **Smart Review Filtering**: Intelligently filters reviews to show only those relevant to the specific instructor, providing more accurate insights.
*   **UCSB Plat Integration**: Provides direct links to professor profiles and curriculum pages on UCSB Plat.
