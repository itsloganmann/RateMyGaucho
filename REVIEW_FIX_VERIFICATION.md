# Review Display Fix - Verification Guide

## Problem Solved

**Issue:** Many reviews from `final.csv` were not displaying because the gating logic required reviews to explicitly mention the instructor's **last name**. Reviews that only used the **first name** (e.g., "Nathan" instead of "Nathan Schley") were filtered out.

**Root Cause:** The `filterReviewsByInstructor()` function only accepted reviews containing the last name with word boundaries, and the gating logic required `_reviewsFiltered` to be true with reviews present.

---

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added CSV Professor Verification (Primary Fix)

**New Function:** `csvProfessorMatches(courseData, matchedInstructor)`

- Compares the `csvProfessor` field from `final.csv` with the matched instructor
- Uses diacritic-safe, case-insensitive matching
- Accepts when CSV professor includes the instructor's last name

**New Function:** `normalizePlain(s)` - Helper for simple normalization

### 2. Enhanced Gating Logic

**Old Logic:**
```javascript
const gatedCourseData = (courseData && courseData._reviewsFiltered && Array.isArray(courseData.recentReviews) && courseData.recentReviews.length > 0)
	? courseData
	: null;
```

**New Logic:**
```javascript
const verifiedByCsvProfessor = csvProfessorMatches(courseData, match);
const verifiedByFlag = typeof courseData?.reviewVerification === 'string'
	&& courseData.reviewVerification.toUpperCase().includes('MATCH');

const hasInstructorSpecificReviews = (
	courseData && courseData._reviewsFiltered
	&& Array.isArray(courseData.recentReviews)
	&& courseData.recentReviews.length > 0
);

const gatedCourseData = (courseData && (hasInstructorSpecificReviews || verifiedByCsvProfessor || verifiedByFlag))
	? courseData
	: null;
```

**Result:** Course data now passes gate if ANY of:
1. Reviews explicitly mention last name (original behavior)
2. CSV professor field matches the instructor
3. `review_verification` field is "MATCH"

### 3. Enhanced Review Filtering (Secondary Fix)

**Added to `filterReviewsByInstructor()`:**

- Teaching context terms: `['prof', 'professor', 'instructor', 'lecture', 'class', 'midterm', 'final', 'homework', 'assignment', 'exam', 'grade', 'quiz', 'teach']`
- New secondary filter: Accept reviews that mention **first name + teaching term**
- Conservative approach: Requires both first name AND context to avoid false positives

**Example:** Review saying "Nathan is one of the worse profs..." now matches because:
- Contains first name: "Nathan" ✓
- Contains teaching term: "profs" ✓

## Test Cases

### Case 1: MATH 4B - Nathan Schley

**Data from final.csv (line 1178):**
- Professor: Nathan Schley
- Verification: MATCH
- Reviews: 119/119
- Review samples all use "Nathan" (first name only) with teaching terms

**Before Fix:**
- ❌ Reviews filtered out (no "Schley" in text)
- ❌ Gate blocked (no instructor-specific reviews)
- ❌ Course info not displayed

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Reviews pass filter (first name + teaching context)
- ✅ Gate passes (CSV professor matches "Nathan Schley")
- ✅ Gate also passes (verification = "MATCH")
- ✅ All 3 reviews display

### Case 2: MATH 6A - XU Yang

**Data from final.csv (line 1179):**
- Professor: XU Yang
- Verification: MISMATCH
- Reviews: 12 expected, 24 found
- Reviews use "yang" or "Yang"

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Reviews pass filter (last name "yang" in text)
- ✅ Gate passes (CSV professor matches "XU Yang")
- ✅ Reviews display despite MISMATCH status

### Case 3: ANTH 3 - Stuart Smith

**Data from final.csv:**
- Professor: Stuart Smith
- Verification: MISMATCH
- Reviews: 6 expected, 122 found

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Reviews mentioning "Smith" pass (original behavior)
- ✅ Gate passes (CSV professor matches)
- ✅ Reviews display

### Case 4: ANTH 113 - Emiko Saldivar

**Data from final.csv:**
- Professor: Emiko Saldivar
- Verification: MATCH
- Reviews: 9/9

**After Fix:**
- ✅ Reviews mentioning "Saldivar" pass (original behavior)
- ✅ Gate passes (verification = MATCH)
- ✅ All reviews display

## Verification Steps

### Step 1: Check Console Logs

After loading the extension and searching for courses, look for:

**Good signs:**
```
[RateMyGaucho] Course data chosen for instructor: Nathan Schley -> MATH 4B
  filteredReviews: 3 (filtered)
```

**No more skipped messages for verified courses:**
```
❌ [RateMyGaucho] SKIPPED course data for Nathan Schley - no instructor-specific reviews found
```

### Step 2: Run Diagnostic Commands

In Chrome DevTools Console on GOLD page:

```javascript
// Check if course data is loaded and has reviews
(async () => {
  const cl = await ensureCoursesLoaded();
  const recs = cl.get('MATH 4B');
  console.log('MATH 4B records:', recs?.length);
  console.log('CSV Professor:', recs?.[0]?.csvProfessor);
  console.log('Verification:', recs?.[0]?.reviewVerification);
  console.log('Reviews:', recs?.[0]?.recentReviews?.length);
  console.log('Sample review:', recs?.[0]?.recentReviews?.[0]?.substring(0, 100));
})();
```

**Expected output:**
```
MATH 4B records: 1
CSV Professor: Nathan Schley
Verification: MATCH
Reviews: 3
Sample review: Nathan would often go into tangents and not really teach concepts in a way that leaves you feel...
```

### Step 3: Visual Verification

On GOLD course search results:

1. Search for "MATH 4B"
2. Look for Nathan Schley's rating card
3. **New fields should show:**
   - Professor (PLAT): Nathan Schley
   - Verification: MATCH • Reviews: 119/119
   - Recent Reviews section with up to 2 reviews
4. Reviews should mention "Nathan" (first name)

### Step 4: Test Multiple Courses

| Course | Professor | Should Show Reviews? |
|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| MATH 4B | Nathan Schley | ✅ Yes (MATCH + first name) |
| MATH 6A | XU Yang | ✅ Yes (CSV match + last name) |
| ANTH 3 | Stuart Smith | ✅ Yes (CSV match + MISMATCH) |
| ANTH 113 | Emiko Saldivar | ✅ Yes (MATCH + last name) |

## Performance Impact

**Minimal:** 
- Added 2 simple string comparison functions
- Gate now checks 3 conditions instead of 1 (negligible CPU cost)
- Filter now checks teaching terms (one extra `some()` call per review)
- No additional CSV loading or parsing

**Estimated Impact:** <1ms additional processing per instructor match

---

## Safety Guarantees

### False Positive Prevention

1. **CSV Verification Primary:** Only trusted when `csvProfessor` field explicitly lists the instructor
2. **Teaching Context Required:** First-name-only matches need teaching terms to avoid "Nathan" matching every Nathan in reviews
3. **Verification Flag Respected:** "MATCH" status from data processing pipeline honored
4. **Original Behavior Preserved:** Last name mentions still work exactly as before

### Backward Compatibility

- ✅ Works with old CSV format (no `csvProfessor` field)
- ✅ Falls back to original gating if no verification available
- ✅ All existing review display logic unchanged
- ✅ No breaking changes to UI or data structures

## Code Changes Summary

**Files Modified:** 1 (`content/content.js`)

**Functions Added:** 2
- `normalizePlain()` - Simple normalization helper
- `csvProfessorMatches()` - CSV professor verification

**Functions Modified:** 2
- `filterReviewsByInstructor()` - Added first name + context filtering
- Gating logic in `observeAndRender()` - Multi-condition gate

**Lines Changed:** ~30 (additions only, no deletions)

---

## Known Limitations

1. **First name must be relatively unique:** Common names like "John" might still have false positives (mitigated by teaching context requirement)
2. **Teaching terms must be present:** Reviews saying only "Nathan was great" won't match (by design, for safety)
3. **CSV professor must be accurate:** Relies on `final.csv` having correct professor names

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert the gating logic to original:

```javascript
// Remove verification checks, restore original gate:
const gatedCourseData = (courseData && courseData._reviewsFiltered && Array.isArray(courseData.recentReviews) && courseData.recentReviews.length > 0)
	? courseData
	: null;
```

Or reload extension from git if needed (changes are local only).

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Fix is successful if:**

1. MATH 4B (Nathan Schley) shows 3 reviews mentioning "Nathan"
2. No "SKIPPED" logs for verified MATCH courses
3. Console shows verification paths: `verifiedByCsvProfessor` or `verifiedByFlag` = true
4. All existing functionality preserved (stars, ratings, links)
5. No false positives (wrong reviews for wrong instructors)

---

**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete - Ready for Testing

**Next:** Load extension unpacked in Chrome and verify test cases
